# TypeAnnotationExercise
An exercise of type annotations for co-authors before actually conducting the 
experiment.

## AnnotationFacilitator
A GUI application which facilitates the annotation process is in this folder. 
It displays the URLs of the issue pages and fix commit pages on GitHub. 

We can use this facilitator to navigate different, here only 5, projects and 
record the time spent in annotating.

## Projects
Five projects which have been checked out to the buggy parents of the fix 
commits are in this folder.

## Guidance
Chris suggested that for annotation, each of us creates two branches for 
TypeScript and Flow. We record our results to the google spreadsheet that has
been shared among us.
