Gozala/narwhal-xulrunner	5	b9734c1884ce5f7df8bcc3ea7b2cc15be1a8239a	TypeScript	Unknown	The reported error is a type error:  a variable that the developer expected would be a function isn't in some case.  That said, I can't see how to annotate or restructure the code so that TypeScript could detect it.  I simply don't follow the code in io-engine.js.	204

courtc/jikp	2	5fb2052b6437a43224a44041ccfec7782a8d2eb3	TypeScript	Undetectable	EIS:  Even if you defined a new type with the new hit range, it would not have prevented this issue, because, in that case the error would have manifested itself as choosing the wrong type.	114
deplicator/xkcdTime_atyourownpace	47	b7698ef7b6f040040534f342b5c40aaea82a84ef	TypeScript	Undetectable	This bug is a kind of range error.  The lowerbound could be enforced by a type system of the expressivity of Flow or TypeScript at the cost of adding operators to manipulate this type that prevent the lowerbound from being bound to a negative value.  The upperbound, however, is dynamic and would require a dependent type system to express.	87
djaodjin/djaodjin-annotate	32	671c6bc597b9cd965e1597756d392bc3cb2941f8	Flow	Unknown	The failure to correctly destroy has created an illegitimate program state that subsequently causes a type error upon trying to access the path property of some unspecified variable.  The bug report does not specify which variable or where.  Thus, I cannot determine where to add type annotations.	233

es-analysis/plato	6	8c2b68ebc170938d4115148f71846ed6247409ed	Flow	Detectable	Adding the minimal annotations to type report.complexity.maintainability caused Flow to error on the null dereference.	63

mnutt/hummingbird	4	10f3a0c1c7da28c3c695ec4dd74c807aee2a8bb3	Flow	Detectable	Flow would have detected this bug.  It also detects that configJSON could be unitialized.  	49
mnutt/hummingbird	4	10f3a0c1c7da28c3c695ec4dd74c807aee2a8bb3	TypeScript	Unknown	It seems like it must be detectable, but I could not get tsc to error on it.  The problem is that a file object was being treated as a string.  This seems like a classic example of a problem that a type system of the granularity and power of TypeScript should be able to detect!  This is a candidate for a deep dive.  No matter how I changed the signature of fs.readFileSync in node.d.ts, tsc never errored.	600
moelders/simple-async	10	502b2b65e00845d46fe1fb2ee5346f8772aea919	Flow	Undetectable	EIS:  here failure to ensure a directory existed.	26

nationalparkservice/places-api	9	d8afcd3d18143f1da000912e945305f0747409bd	TypeScript	Unknown	Clearly, the error is a TypeError, so it seems possible in principle to catch it with TS/Flow, but it is unclear to me where to place the needed annotations and how much restructuring of the code might be entailed.	44

ng2/auth	8	2783b21e9b7abf15ee7bf7562be64c96bfcc56b2	Flow	Detectable	Flow, with a type annotation hack, detects this bug, in accordance with intuition.  It's a hack because I couldn't find the definition of the object bound to $location and therefore the definition of search.  Nonetheless, it approximates the annotation cost of the correctly placed annotation.	241
ng2/auth	8	2783b21e9b7abf15ee7bf7562be64c96bfcc56b2	TypeScript	Detectable	Backporting the annotation hack from my solution for Flow works for TypeScript as well.  Thus, I am changing my classification.	639
opsmezzo/quill-template	13	3342f999fcf48fece0b45bddd0e63d0cfe18446e	Flow	Undetectable	EIS.  The missing parameters are optional, presumably for a reason.  The buggy call was therefore incorrect because the developer who wrote it was being sloppy or just mischoose the call and therefore failed to implement the intended bahavior.  Interestingly, Flow detects an error on the JSON.parse call which was not fixed and presumably not erroneous.	73

smo-key/trello2latex	21	cdcf777465874a7c68db5baf8e86d4fb2380c4a8	Flow	Detectable	I finally figured out how to correctly define the type annotations to get Flow to work.	602
smo-key/trello2latex	21	cdcf777465874a7c68db5baf8e86d4fb2380c4a8	TypeScript	Undetectable	Other:  limitation of TS, lack on notnull annotation.  TypeScript, out of the box, errors on card.name.  It complains that it doesn't exist on {}, not that it could be null, which is what the fix checks.  Here, the fact that TypeScript does not allow a developer to specify that a type is non-nullable prevents it from detecting the actual bug.	126
